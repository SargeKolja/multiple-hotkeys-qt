# multiple-hotkeys-qt

Very easy and flat class to assign multiple hotkeys one or more Qt Buttons. Supporting all elements which are derived from QAbstractButton.
In addition, one can add a final line to the buttons tooltip. So a user can see which hotkeys are supported by hoovering the mouse over.
Tooltips are dynamically: change hotkey assignement or change button label is adjusting the tooltip. No subclassing, no class injection, no TPL.

For Qt4 and Qt5 since some days, used in commercial Qt4 and Qt5 projects by one contributor in the meantime.
